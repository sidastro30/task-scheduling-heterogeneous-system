# task-scheduling-heterogeneous-system
Most of the embedded & VLSI systems can be modelled as DAG, such as circuit routing and flow of task execution in Adaptive Cruise Control in Automotive Systems, logic synthesis in digital VLSI etc. These systems have precedence task constraints, and tasks can be distributed as per resource availability. Tasks are allocated on the available heterogeneous system having different computing capabilities to run individual tasks, which are arranged accordingly offline Scheduling scheme.
